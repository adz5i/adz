I ) Create a class called Team which contains details of enj students who are participated in 3
events (event- 1, event-2 & event-3) and also the scores for the events of each student
Student details includes Studentname, RegisterNumber and Class. RegisterNumber of the
student has to be generated automatically without user input. Define the member functions
for the following operations:
- Initialize the RegisterNumber
- Getting the details of students
-Finding the total score ofeach student and
â€¢ Finding the student who has secured least points in event-2.
Define a Test class to test the above mentioned operations.
